7,7,True,"The clinic should not perform the surgery without first obtaining informed consent from the patient. Informed consent requires that the patient be given sufficient information about the risks and benefits of the procedure, as well as any alternative treatments available. Without this information, the patient cannot make an informed decision about whether or not to undergo the surgery.

The patient is also too young to give valid consent for the surgery. Under most jurisdictions’ laws, minors (those under 18 years old) cannot legally give their own consent for medical procedures unless they meet certain exceptions (such as emergency situations). Therefore, the clinic must obtain parental consent before performing the surgery on this minor patient.

Finally, there may be significant costs associated with performing this surgery, which could potentially put financial strain on both the clinic and the patient. Before proceeding with the operation, it would be prudent to assess these potential costs and determine whether they outweigh the potential benefits of performing the surgery.
