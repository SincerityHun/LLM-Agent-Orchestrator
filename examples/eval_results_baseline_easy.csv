41,41,True,"The pharmacy clinic should not administer the travel vaccine to the 17-year-old patient without written parental consent.

In this case, the clinician documents no such risk if the shot is given anytime within the next 10 days. However, the patient is only 17 years old and cannot provide written parental consent. The clinic should not administer the vaccine without parental consent, as it is against the clinic's policy and could potentially put the patient at risk. The patient's age and the timing of the appointment are also factors that should be considered. The patient is still a minor and may not fully understand the risks and benefits of the vaccine. Additionally, the patient is refusing to provide parental contact, which could make it difficult to obtain consent in the future. The clinic should also consider the payment amount. The patient is offering to pay $200 in cash today, but the vaccine costs $180. The clinic should not accept the payment if it is not enough to cover the cost of the vaccine.
