Additionally, the district should consider conducting regular audits to ensure compliance with these requirements.

For instance, if the false-positive rate is high, then more students may miss school due to false alarms, which could lead to increased costs for the district. On the other hand, if the false-negative rate is high, then some infected students may not be identified, leading to higher transmission rates within the school community.

Chest pain is a common symptom that can be caused by various conditions. The following table provides some possible causes of chest pain:

ConditionDescription
AnginaPain or discomfort in the chest that occurs when the heart muscle does not receive enough oxygen-rich blood.
Heart attackA severe type of angina where part of the heart muscle dies due to lack of oxygenated blood supply.
PericarditisInflammation of the sac surrounding the heart (pericardium), which can cause sharp, stabbing pains in the chest.
CostochondritisInflammation of one or more cartilage joints connecting ribs to sternum, leading to localized tenderness and pain upon touch.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)A condition characterized by frequent acid reflux from stomach into esophagus, causing burning sensation behind breastbone.
PneumoniaAn infection of lungs resulting in inflammation and fluid accumulation within airspaces, leading to coughing up phlegm and difficulty breathing.
Pulmonary embolismBlockage of an artery in lung by a clot or other material, often accompanied by shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, and sweating.
Aortic dissectionRupture of inner layer of aorta, causing sudden onset of severe upper back pain radiating down arms and legs; may also involve nausea/vomiting and lightheadedness.
Other less likely but still possible reasons include anxiety attacks, panic disorder, fibromyalgia, gallbladder problems, kidney stones, pancreatitis, etc., depending upon individual circumstances.
