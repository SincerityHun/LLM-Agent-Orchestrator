    "task": "A home health agency is deciding whether to start next-day in-home wound-care visits for a 17-year-old after a minor surgery; the visits cost $250 per day for 4 days (total $1,000). Agency policy, reflecting the stated regulation, requires a parent or legal guardian to consent for non-emergency services for anyone under 18, and the clinician documents the wound is stable so a 5-day delay does not create a serious health risk. The patient offers to pay $600 upfront and asks the agency not to contact their parents, but the guardian can sign consent in 5 days—what should the agency do?",
