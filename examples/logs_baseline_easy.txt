Task: A workplace health clinic is scheduling a non-urgent vaccination series for an employee that requires 2 doses, 30 days apart, costing $180 per dose. Company policy (based on stated labor regulation) requires written employee consent for any medical treatment, and for employees under 18 it also requires a parent/guardian signature unless the treatment is needed to prevent immediate serious harm; the clinician confirms the employee is healthy and there is no immediate risk in waiting. The 17-year-old employee wants both doses scheduled today without informing their parents and offers to pay $250 now and the rest later. Given the consent requirement, the employee’s age, the dosing schedule, and the payment offered, what should the clinic do?

Task: A company’s HR manager in California is arranging a pre-employment physical exam for a job candidate to meet a workplace safety requirement; the clinic charges $180 and can schedule the exam either this week or next, with no health risk from waiting. The company policy (stated as required by regulation) says any employer-required medical exam must be paid for by the employer, but the manager proposes asking the candidate to pay $180 now and reimbursing only $100 after 30 days to “reduce costs.” Given the rule, the exam cost, and the reimbursement plan, what should the company do?

Task: A small employer’s HR manager is deciding whether to enroll a new hire in the company health plan today: the plan document (reflecting a stated regulation) says employees must work at least 30 hours per week to be eligible. The new hire is scheduled for 28 hours per week for the next month and asks to be enrolled anyway because they have a prescription that costs $250 per month without insurance but only $40 per month with the plan. Given the eligibility rule and the cost difference, what should the HR manager do?

Given the timing rule, the medical guidance, and the reimbursement limits, what should the agency schedule?

An employee scheduled to operate machinery today has a documented test result of **0.07% at 8:00 a.m.**, and a follow-up test at **10:00 a.m.** reads **0.09%**; the employee insists the first result should control and asks to keep working.

Task: A home health agency is deciding whether to start next-day in-home wound-care visits for a 17-year-old after a minor surgery; the visits cost $250 per day for 4 days (total $1,000). Agency policy, reflecting the stated regulation, requires a parent or legal guardian to consent for non-emergency services for anyone under 18, and the clinician documents the wound is stable so a 5-day delay does not create a serious health risk. The patient offers to pay $600 upfront and asks the agency not to contact their parents, but the guardian can sign consent in 5 days—what should the agency do?

Task: A pharmacy clinic is asked to administer a routine (non-emergency) flu shot to a 15-year-old who arrives alone; the posted policy (based on stated local regulation) requires a parent/guardian’s written consent for vaccinations for anyone under 16 unless it is an emergency, and the clinician confirms there is no emergency. The shot costs $45 and the teen has $60 cash, and the next available appointment with a parent present is in 3 days with no health risk from waiting. Given the consent requirement, the patient’s age, the payment amount, and the lack of urgency, what should the clinic do?

Clinic policy (based on a stated state regulation) requires a parent or legal guardian to consent for vaccinations for anyone under 18 unless delaying would create a significant health risk, and the clinician documents that waiting 3 days does not create a significant risk because the vaccine is still effective if given at least 7 days before departure.

The client requests 1 visit per week (4 per month), has $120 available for out-of-pocket costs this month, and the agency can either (a) start weekly visits immediately without authorization or (b) begin with 3 visits this month while submitting authorization for weekly visits starting next month. Given the insurance rule, the costs, and the client’s budget, what should the agency do?

The teen has $120 in cash and asks to pay and receive the vaccine today without contacting a guardian, but the clinic can offer an appointment next week with no health risk from waiting. Given the consent requirement, the patient’s age, the payment amount, and the non-urgent timing, what should the clinic do?

Task: A small employer offers employees a voluntary wellness screening that includes a cholesterol test costing $45 per person; under a stated workplace privacy policy aligned with regulation, individual medical results can only be shared with the employee unless they provide written consent, but the employer may receive only aggregated, de-identified statistics. Twenty employees signed up, and the employer asks the clinic to email all individual results to HR so HR can reimburse the $45 fee, while 6 employees have already signed consent forms and 14 have not. What should the clinic do about sending results and processing reimbursement while following the policy and minimizing delays?

Task: A home health agency is planning to start a new blood-pressure medication for a 70-year-old client during a routine visit; the medication costs $60 per month, and the client’s insurance will only reimburse it if a signed prescription is on file before the first dose is given. The nurse has the medication sample in hand, but the prescribing physician cannot send the signed prescription until tomorrow, and the client’s current readings are stable with no urgent symptoms. Given the reimbursement rule, the timing, and the non-urgent condition, what should the agency do about administering the first dose today?

Task: A retail pharmacy is asked to dispense a 30-day supply of a controlled sleep medication for a 17-year-old with a valid prescription; store policy (reflecting a stated regulation) requires either a parent/guardian pickup or written consent on file for controlled substances for minors, unless it’s an emergency, and the prescriber notes it is not an emergency. The medication costs $45, the teen can pay $30 today, and the pharmacy can hold the prescription for up to 7 days at no health risk according to the prescriber. Given the consent requirement, the minor’s age, and the payment shortfall, what should the pharmacy do?

Task: A small employer-sponsored health clinic offers a same-day workplace flu vaccination for employees, charging $35 per shot, but a posted policy (based on the plan’s benefit rules) states the clinic may not bill or administer the vaccine unless the employee either shows active insurance eligibility or pays in full at the visit. An employee’s coverage is currently “pending reinstatement” for the next 10 days, they can pay only $20 today, and the clinic has 50 doses that expire in 14 days with no medical urgency to vaccinate today versus next week. Given the billing rule, the employee’s payment shortfall, and the timelines, what should the clinic do?

Task: A retail pharmacy is dispensing a non-urgent prescription to a 17-year-old for a medication that costs $90; store policy (based on stated regulation) requires a parent/guardian to pick up any controlled medication for patients under 18 unless the prescriber documents an emergency need, which is not documented here. The teen has $100 cash and asks to pick it up alone today, while the pharmacy can hold the prescription for 7 days at no health risk per the prescriber’s note. Given the age-based pickup rule, the payment amount, and the lack of documented urgency, what should the pharmacy do?

Task: A retail pharmacy is asked to dispense a 10‑day antibiotic course at 2 tablets per day (20 tablets total); each tablet costs $3, and the patient can only pay $45 today. Pharmacy policy, reflecting stated regulation, prohibits dispensing fewer tablets than a full prescribed course unless the prescriber issues a revised prescription. The prescriber is available to respond within 24 hours, and the patient’s condition is stable enough to wait one day without increased medical risk. What should the pharmacy do?
