Task: A workplace health clinic is scheduling a non-urgent vaccination series for an employee that requires 2 doses, 30 days apart, costing $180 per dose. Company policy (based on stated labor regulation) requires written employee consent for any medical treatment, and for employees under 18 it also requires a parent/guardian signature unless the treatment is needed to prevent immediate serious harm; the clinician confirms the employee is healthy and there is no immediate risk in waiting. The 17-year-old employee wants both doses scheduled today without informing their parents and offers to pay $250 now and the rest later. Given the consent requirement, the employee’s age, the dosing schedule, and the payment offered, what should the clinic do?

Task: A company’s HR manager in California is arranging a pre-employment physical exam for a job candidate to meet a workplace safety requirement; the clinic charges $180 and can schedule the exam either this week or next, with no health risk from waiting. The company policy (stated as required by regulation) says any employer-required medical exam must be paid for by the employer, but the manager proposes asking the candidate to pay $180 now and reimbursing only $100 after 30 days to “reduce costs.” Given the rule, the exam cost, and the reimbursement plan, what should the company do?

Task: A small employer’s HR manager is deciding whether to enroll a new hire in the company health plan today: the plan document (reflecting a stated regulation) says employees must work at least 30 hours per week to be eligible. The new hire is scheduled for 28 hours per week for the next month and asks to be enrolled anyway because they have a prescription that costs $250 per month without insurance but only $40 per month with the plan. Given the eligibility rule and the cost difference, what should the HR manager do?

An employee scheduled to operate machinery today has a documented test result of **0.07% at 8:00 a.m.**, and a follow-up test at **10:00 a.m.** reads **0.09%**; the employee insists the first result should control and asks to keep working.

Task: A home health agency is deciding whether to start next-day in-home wound-care visits for a 17-year-old after a minor surgery; the visits cost $250 per day for 4 days (total $1,000). Agency policy, reflecting the stated regulation, requires a parent or legal guardian to consent for non-emergency services for anyone under 18, and the clinician documents the wound is stable so a 5-day delay does not create a serious health risk. The patient offers to pay $600 upfront and asks the agency not to contact their parents, but the guardian can sign consent in 5 days—what should the agency do?

Task: A pharmacy is dispensing a new blood-pressure medication that should be taken once daily for 30 days; the prescription label allows a 5-day emergency supply without a new prescription, but dispensing more than 5 days requires a valid refill authorization under the stated regulation. A patient’s refill request was denied by the prescriber, and the patient has 3 pills left and says they cannot see a doctor for 10 days; the pharmacy has enough stock to provide any amount. Given the rule, the remaining pills, and the 10-day gap, what should the pharmacy do?

Task: A home health agency is asked to start non-emergency in-home nursing visits for a 17-year-old recovering from a minor surgery; agency policy (based on stated regulation) requires a parent or legal guardian to sign consent for patients under 18 unless delaying care would pose an immediate serious health risk, which the clinician confirms it will not. The care plan is 4 visits at $150 each (total $600), and the patient offers to pay $600 from their own savings and asks the agency not to contact their parents, while the agency can safely start the visits in 10 days after obtaining guardian consent. Given the consent rule, the patient’s age, the cost, and the lack of urgency, what should the agency do?

Task: A home healthcare agency is arranging weekly in-home nurse visits for a 70-year-old client with diabetes; each visit costs $150, and the client’s insurance plan reimburses 80% of covered visits but requires prior authorization for any schedule exceeding 3 visits per month. The client requests 1 visit per week (4 per month), has $120 available for out-of-pocket costs this month, and the agency can either (a) start weekly visits immediately without authorization or (b) begin with 3 visits this month while submitting authorization for weekly visits starting next month. Given the insurance rule, the costs, and the client’s budget, what should the agency do?

Task: A home healthcare agency is discharging a 17-year-old patient after a non-emergency wound-care visit that costs $300; the agency policy (reflecting its stated regulation) requires a parent/guardian to sign for treatment of minors unless delaying care would create a serious health risk, which the nurse documents is not the case. The teen wants to pay immediately using $200 cash and a $150 prepaid card and asks the nurse not to contact their parents, while the agency can reschedule the visit for next week without medical harm. Given the consent rule, the patient’s age, the non-urgent status, and the available payment amounts, what should the agency do?

Task: A small employer offers employees a voluntary wellness screening that includes a cholesterol test costing $45 per person; under a stated workplace privacy policy aligned with regulation, individual medical results can only be shared with the employee unless they provide written consent, but the employer may receive only aggregated, de-identified statistics. Twenty employees signed up, and the employer asks the clinic to email all individual results to HR so HR can reimburse the $45 fee, while 6 employees have already signed consent forms and 14 have not. What should the clinic do about sending results and processing reimbursement while following the policy and minimizing delays?

Task: A home health agency is planning to start a new blood-pressure medication for a 70-year-old client during a routine visit; the medication costs $60 per month, and the client’s insurance will only reimburse it if a signed prescription is on file before the first dose is given. The nurse has the medication sample in hand, but the prescribing physician cannot send the signed prescription until tomorrow, and the client’s current readings are stable with no urgent symptoms. Given the reimbursement rule, the timing, and the non-urgent condition, what should the agency do about administering the first dose today?

Task: A small employer-sponsored health clinic offers a same-day workplace flu vaccination for employees, charging $35 per shot, but a posted policy (based on the plan’s benefit rules) states the clinic may not bill or administer the vaccine unless the employee either shows active insurance eligibility or pays in full at the visit. An employee’s coverage is currently “pending reinstatement” for the next 10 days, they can pay only $20 today, and the clinic has 50 doses that expire in 14 days with no medical urgency to vaccinate today versus next week. Given the billing rule, the employee’s payment shortfall, and the timelines, what should the clinic do?
