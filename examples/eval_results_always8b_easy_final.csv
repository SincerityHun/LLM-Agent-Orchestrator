2,2,True,"The HR manager should use their judgment to decide whether or not to hire the applicant. They can consider factors such as the applicant's qualifications, experience, and fit with the company culture. Additionally, they may want to conduct further interviews or background checks before making a final decision.

The HR manager should explain why they decided to reject the candidate. This could include reasons like lack of relevant experience or skills, poor performance during the interview process, or concerns about the candidate's character or behavior. It is important to provide specific examples and be clear and concise in your explanation.

In order to enroll the new hire in the company health plan, the HR manager must obtain written consent from the employee or their parent/guardian if they are under 18 years old. This is required by HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) regulations. If the employee is over 18, then they can sign the consent form themselves. However, it is still advisable to get parental permission if possible, especially since minors often rely on their parents for financial support.

The HR manager should provide feedback to the applicant about why they were not hired. This could include information about the specific reasons for their rejection, such as lack of relevant experience or poor communication skills.

44,44,True,"The CDC recommends that all children get vaccinated against certain diseases. Vaccines can protect people from serious illnesses and even save lives. They also help stop the spread of infectious diseases. Vaccinations are an important part of keeping your child healthy and safe. Here's what you need to know about vaccines for kids:

- Children should receive routine immunizations according to their age group (see table below). These include shots such as DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis), Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b), polio, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), varicella (chickenpox) and hepatitis B.

- Some states require proof of vaccination before entering school or day care centers. Check with local health departments or schools regarding specific requirements in your area.

- Parents may choose not to vaccinate their children due to personal beliefs or religious reasons. However, they must provide written documentation stating this decision when enrolling them in public schools or other facilities where immunization records are required by law.

- If you have any questions about whether your child needs a particular vaccine, talk to his/her doctor or nurse practitioner. They will be able to advise you based on your child’s individual risk factors and medical history.

A thorough history and physical examination should be performed to assess for any potential underlying medical conditions such as anemia, thyroid dysfunction, or depression. Laboratory testing may also be indicated to rule out other possible causes of fatigue. Once these factors have been ruled out, the patient can begin treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) which has been shown to be effective in treating insomnia and improving sleep quality. CBT involves teaching patients how to change their thoughts and behaviors related to sleep so they can develop better sleeping habits. This includes learning relaxation techniques, establishing regular bedtime routines, avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed, and limiting exposure to bright lights at night. Additionally, medications like benzodiazepines or non-benzodiazepine hypnotics may be prescribed if needed but should only be used short-term due to potential side effects and risk of dependence.
